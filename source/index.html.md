# Introduction

Welcome to the Payhere API! You can use our API to send and receive money, through major mobile money providers, visa and bank transfers

We have language bindings in PHP and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

Payhere APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) is payment platform powerhouse. Behind these APIs is a software layer connecting and optimizing payments services around the world to allow businesses to send and receive money, globally.

# Getting started

Go to https://dashboard.payhere.africa/register and create a merchant account. If you have a merchant account already, go to the next step.

Once you sign in, you will generate API keys (sid and token). Protect these credentials at all times including but not limited to avoiding saving them to source code repositories.

You can always re-generate the sid and token if compromised or need to change it.

In as much as you can test on the sandbox as you wish, once you are ready to go into production contact `legal@payhere.africa` so your account gets approved. Once approved then can start to receive and send payments.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```php
// Update the path below to your autoload.php,
// see https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md
require_once '/path/to/vendor/autoload.php';

use Payhere\Rest\Client;

// Find your App id and Auth Token at https://dashboard.payhere.africa

$appId    = "your_app_id";
$token  = "your_auth_token";
$payhere = new Client($appId, $token);

```

```javascript
// Download the helper library from https://www.twilio.com/docs/node/install
// Your APP ID and Auth Token from https://dashboard.payhere.africa
const appId = 'your_app_id';
const authToken = 'your_auth_token';
const client = require('payhere')(appId, authToken);

```

> Make sure to replace `your_app_id` with your APP ID

Payhere uses APP ID to allow access to the API. You can register a new Payhere APP ID at our [merchant portal](https://dashboard.payhere.africa).

Payhere expects for the APP ID to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`APP-ID: your_app_id`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>your_app_id</code> with your personal APP ID.
